### Hi People

My name is Gabriel, but I prefer been called Ellyzeul, my nickname and a pseudonym.<br><br>
I started studying programming because I didn't knew anything that I could do for a living and programming looked like something that I could enjoy and earn enough to live and to have a family (altough I'm still single, but I'm looking to the future).<br><br>
I started my studies at SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP) on Computer Science course and what a first sight just looked like something that I could enjoy, now I really love it!<br><br>
Now I'm on my fifth semester and as the time passes by, I'm studying more and more aside from university.

### Interest areas
I have two principal areas of my interest, that are:
- Games
- Web backend

But to be honest I study much more backend than game dev...

### Fav Langs
I know some languages and love the functional ones, because I love functional programming (altough I'm not a specialist at it).<br><br>
To put in a list, my fav langs are:

- <img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/elixir/elixir-original.svg"> Elixir
- <img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/c/c-original.svg"> C (as my first learned lang, C has a special place in the heart)


### Final considerations
That's me.
